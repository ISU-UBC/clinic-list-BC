## Code Used (V1)
* camp.py
* filters.py
* final_list.py
* geocode.py
* geocode_added.py
* geocode_flagged.py

## Code Used (V2, *In Development*)
* step1.py
* step3.py

## Steps (V1)
1. Ensure all materials are local (change directory if required), run 'camp.py'
2. This will return 'modified.xlsx'
3. Run 'geocode.py' *NOTE: Geocoding is a time-consuming process and may take upwards of 20-30 minutes as limits are placed on queried addresses.*
4. This will return 'flagged_lists.xlsx'
5. Run 'geocode_added.py'.
6. This will return 'flagged_added.xlsx'
7. Rename 'flagged_lists.xlsx' to 'flagged_lists_manual_edits.xlsx'. Making a copy of the original file is recommended.
8. Manually edit any flagged items to a proper format (column FLAG = 1 in excel file). I would recommend verifying manual edits through [DataBC's geocoding services demo.](https://bcgov.github.io/ols-devkit/ols-demo/index.html)
9. Run 'geocode_flagged.py'.
10. This will return 'working_list.xlsx'
11. Repeat step 8 on the working list if necessary.
12. Run 'filters.py'.
13. This will return 'filtered_list.xlsx'
14. Run 'final_list.py'.
15. This will return 'clinic_list.xlsx'
16. Enjoy!

## Steps (V2, *In Development*)
1. Ensure all materials are in materials folder locally (change directory if required), run 'step1.py'. *NOTE: Geocoding is a time-consuming process and may take upwards of 20-30 minutes as limits are placed on queried addresses.*
2. This will return 'OUTPUT_STEP1.xlsx'
3. Rename 'OUTPUT_STEP1.xlsx' to 'INPUT_STEP2.xlsx'. Making a copy of the original file is recommended.
4. Manually edit any flagged items to a proper format (column FLAG = 1 in excel file). I would recommend verifying manual edits through [DataBC's geocoding services demo.](https://bcgov.github.io/ols-devkit/ols-demo/index.html)
5. Run 'step3.py'.
6. This will return 'FINAL.xlsx'
7. Enjoy!
